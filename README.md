# Product Name
Because programming sucks.

## Installation

Download the [https://github.com/w-biggs/left-pad/releases/latest](latest .zip release), then install it via the "Add Plugin" button on WordPress's "Plugins" page.

## Usage example

Just use the shortcode in any WordPress text area. Easy peasy. A few examples:

```
[left-pad foo 5]
// => "  foo"

[left-pad foobar 6]
// => "foobar"

[left-pad 1 2 0]
// => "01"

[left-pad 17 5 0]
// => "00017"
```

**Note:** The third argument should be a single character. Obviously.
